# The Death of Melody? Trajectories and Revolutions in Western Pop Music

This is the code base for the Death of Melody project. Python 3 and R are utilized for analysis. For reproduction, please ensure the following Python 
libraries are installed on your machine:

MIDI handling - pretty_midi

Data handling - pandas, numpy, collections, json

Statistics - scipy, statsmodels, sklearn

Visualizations - matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib.gridspec, seaborn

as well as the "ecp" and "ggplot2" R libraries.

You also need to unzip the "midis" folder, keeping it at the same level as the other folders. 

Finally, to run individual scripts, you'll always need to specify the directory to which you downloaded the code.
